# Iterators are methods that naturally (inherently) loop over a given set
# of data and allow you to operate on each element in the collection.

names = ['bob', 'nate', 'is', 'wuz', 'hat-been', 'hat-wuz']

# The .each operator loops through each element in the array.
names. each { |thingy| puts thingy }
